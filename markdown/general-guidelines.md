## Design goals

The goal of this template is to maintain a clear, professional and
consistent tone and appearance among all SUSE presentations. The
default text boxes in the presentation represent the margins or
“working area” to which all text, graphics and diagrams should
conform. These margins are not arbitrary, and they are not meant to
constrict creativity; when used correctly, they keep the slides
focused and leave enough white space so audiences can easily digest
the presented material. If you need more room than the margins allow,
we suggest moving content to another slide.

## Editorial Guidelines

To help you achieve a consistent, professional message, general
guidelines about SUSE style and grammar usage are outlined below.

*   **Acronyms**: Acronyms may be used for industry terms provided you
    spell out the terms at first reference in body copy:

    *   Example: The Independent Software Vendor (ISV) solution …
    *   Do NOT abbreviate product names in external presentations

*   **Capitalization**: The title of the presentation and the title and
    subtitle of each slide are the only elements that should be
    capitalized in title case. All other elements should be
    capitalized in sentence case (only the first word of each sentence
    capitalized). This includes bullet points, call outs, emphasized
    words, table headings and captions.

*   **Hyphenated compounds within titles**: If a hyphenated compound
    appears in a title, capitalize the word following the hyphen; for
    example, “Low-Cost Alternatives” would be capitalized as shown.

*   **Bulleted lists**: To set off the lead text in bulleted lists (the
    words “Bulleted lists” in this case), use colons. Try to keep
    information presented in bulleted lists short, so it is easy for
    audiences to consume.

*   **Punctuation within bulleted lists**: Be consistent when punctuating
    bulleted lists. For example, if you choose to use a complete
    sentence in the first bullet, use complete sentences, and
    punctuate accordingly for all bullets on that slide.

*   **General punctuation**: Use “and” instead of “&” except in proper
    names (e.g., AT&T). Write out percent signs.

## Slide Trademarking Guidelines

The following guidelines are basic rules for product naming and trademarking:

*   **Product naming:** Use the full legal product name at all
    references within the presentation; no product acronyms or
    abbreviations are allowed.

*   **Product trademarking:** SUSE<sub>&reg;</sub> products and
    selected technologies should be trademarked at first reference on
    each slide. This will help us legally protect these marks.

*   **General trademarking:** Each slide should be trademarked
    separately in case the slide is used in multiple decks or pulled
    from one slide deck to another. (This differs from the usual
    guideline of trademarking the first reference of a product or
    technology in a document.)‏

*   **Third-party trademarking:** Except for
    Attachmate<sub>&reg;</sub>, NetIQ<sub>&reg;</sub> and
    Novell<sub>&reg;</sub>, SUSE does not reference third-party
    trademarks.

*   **Trademark design:** Trademarks should be large enough to be
    recognized, but small enough so they do not distract from the
    content.

*   **Trademark placement:** The registered trademark symbol
    (<sub>&reg;</sub>) should go on the baseline of the text. The
    trademark and service mark symbols (™, SM) should be arranged so
    that the top of the symbol is level with the top of the last
    letter of the word being marked.
