## Template Instructions

This slide outlines the basic guidelines and instructions to help you
use the SUSE<sub>&reg;</sub> presentation template.

*   <span style="font-size: 70%">
    The goal of this template is to maintain a clear, professional and
    consistent tone and appearance among all SUSE presentations. The
    default text boxes in the presentation represent the margins or
    “working area” to which all text, graphics and diagrams should
    conform. These margins are not arbitrary, and they are not meant
    to constrict creativity; when used correctly, they keep the slides
    focused and leave enough white space so audiences can easily
    digest the presented material. If you need more room than the
    margins allow, we suggest moving content to another slide.
